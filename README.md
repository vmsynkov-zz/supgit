**This is a nice poem by *Sergei Yesenin* dating 1918**

    There's the silly elation,
    The garden the windows look on!
    Soundless sunset reflection
    Swims in the pool, like a swan.
     
    Greetings, golden serenity,
    Shadows of trees, black as tar!
    Crows on the roof, in sincerity,
    Hold vespers in praise of the star.
     
    Timidly, over the garden
    Where the guelder-rose springs,
    A girl in a snow-white garment
    A beautiful melody sings.
     
    Like a blue gown, the evening
    Cold from the meadow sweeps...
    Happiness, sweet silly feeling!
    Virginal blush of the cheeks!
     
    1918 Sergei Yesenin
